# FinalProjectdata115
This is the final project for Data 115 Summer 2021

-CRITERIA-

* Big Question: Is the question interesting, clearly stated, and specific? Is the chosen dataset a reasonable option for
addressing this question?

* Visualizations: Are the visualizations used to represent the analysis effictive and complete?

* Analysis: Are the methods that we used to analyze the data appropriate and carried out correctly?
Is the analysis thorough and logically conducted?

* Conclusions: Do the final conclusions provide a satisfactory answer to the ‘Big Question’ ?  Are the conclusions supported by the 
  analysis that was performed and presented?

* Reproducibility: Are the data processing and cleaning methods well-documented?  Is the code used to analyze the data correct and 
  easily interpretable?

* Presentation: Is the final report well organized and neat? Are the plots designed with care, including color choices, appropriate labelling, 
  and other aspects of good visualization design?
**1.) Describe the dataset and why you selected it for this project.**

-   The dataset that I choose was the COVID-19 dataset. I wanted to do
    this dataset because it has had a huge impact on the world. The
    functioning of our society has changed dramatically during this
    pandemic. Looking into the data that we had on COVID-19 seemed like
    it would be interesting and provide me with greater understanding of
    what the world has gone through.

**2.) Describe any processing problems you identified with the data and
how you overcame those issues.**

-   One of the issues that I ran into was that all of the data was
    cumulative for one of the datasets that contained deaths and cases
    for every county in the US. The other dataset that I am using is a
    survey of mask use that was done in June 2020. I wanted to limit the
    data that I was using in the cases and deaths dataset to a time
    frame that was close to the time that the survey was taken. Another
    issue was merging the two datasets so that the mask survey data was
    with the cases and deaths dataset.

**3.) Describe your 'Big Question' and why the data is a good choice to
answer it.**

-   The 'Big Question' that I chose was to see how mask use impacted
    death rates in the US. The reason that this is a good dataset for
    answering this question is it contains all of the cases and deaths
    in the US. There is also a dataset that has a survey for how likely
    someone is to wear a mask.

**4.) Describe the results of your exploratory analysis and what
preliminary conclusions you were able to draw based on this analysis.**

-   The results of my exploratory analysis was a little lackluster. It
    was at this point that I realized that a lot more data was going to
    be need to reach the conclusions that I wanted to reach. For
    instance a population dataset would be needed to see the impact of
    masks on infection rate.

**5.) Describe how you selected the methodology for your analysis of the
big question and the pros and cons of that method and any alternative
methods you considered.**

-   The methodology for my analysis was cluster analysis. The analysis
    was able to show that the data was grouped into two clusters. The
    survey results and the death and case results. There was no linear
    relationship between these two variables. This was a classification
    problem as half of the data was a survey.

**6.) Describe your final conclusions based on your analysis and support
them with analytics on your dataset.**

-   Unfortunately the conclusion that I reached was that to make
    meaningful prediction for this I would need to use a non-linear
    analysis which is beyond my current skill set. Another conclusion
    that i reached was that more data would be needed. A population
    dataset would be essential to make limited predictions. More data
    about population density and transmissibility would also be needed.
    It is clear to me that these relationships exist even from my
    limited analysis. Take the map plots of deaths per case and total
    deaths. King county where the highest number of deaths occurred was
    not the highest death per case. With more data these relationships
    could be explored.

**7.) Describe any additional analyses that you would have liked to
carry out and any additional data that would have been needed in order
to extend your analysis.**

-   One issue that I ran into is that the data was not linear related so
    I would like to do a non linear analysis to build a model. More data
    would also be need to be able to draw meaningful conclusions, one
    instance of this would be a population dataset to be able to see the
    effect of masks on infection rate. I know that modeling infection
    rates can get very complicated using epidemiological models.
